# integral-calculator-ai

## An AI that calculates integrals and tells you how to :)

### WHY?

idk its cool :)

### RUNNING

- Install python 3 (<https://www.python.org/downloads/>)
- Install vscode (<https://code.visualstudio.com>) or any equivalent editor
- Once that's done, you should be able to open the jupyter notebook NN_integralcalc in vscode -- open it to the folder of this repo, and make sure your training data is nearby
- Once it's open, run each cell in order to train the model, then run the last one to give it input
